# I am make a responsive resume site. My tasks as bellow:

1. The desktop version of the site will have a 3-column layout. The resume will have a “sidebar” for the headings “Jenna Garcia”, “Projects”, and “Work”.

2. The tablet version will have a 2-column layout. The resume headings will be placed above each section in the resume.

3. The mobile version will completely hide Jenna’s photo, focusing on just the information displayed in the resume.

I only set the first media query. But unforturely, my media query seems doesnt work. 
And, I cannot set the 2-column layout for the table version.
